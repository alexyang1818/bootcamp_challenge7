## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
<br>
<br>
As shown in the above tables, 90,398 roles will need to be filled.
<br>
<br>
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the 
departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
<br>
<br>
Also as shown in the above tables, the number of retirement-ready mentors are significantly less than the number of new hires replacing the retiring employees (only 1.7% by ratio). It might be necessary to invite employees born other than year 1965 to enter the mentorship program.
